# Musical Buzzer
## Description
In this task you will make the buzzer on the Maker Pi Pico play notes. The functions and the note frequencies are provided, as well as an example tune. You will need to implement the function <code>playNote(char* note, int octave, int durationMicroSecs)</code> to play the calculated frequency on the buzzer.

## Task Classification
EASY as it mostly involves simple GPIO outputting. However, this task could be expanded using the PWM which would increase the complexity (see [https://www.i-programmer.info/programming/hardware/14849-the-pico-in-c-basic-pwm.html The Pico in C: Basic PWM]).
